If you start working on something, put your initial in the box, so no one
else starts the same task.
When you're done put in the x to show it's done and move it to the fixed tasks.

-------------------------------
high priority
-------------------------------
[x] MarketingGUI: does not need the ID selection when opening
[x] MarketingGUI: should not implement the machine lock
[ ] MarketingGUI: add button for global statistics
[ ] MarketingGUI: in single statistics, have a list of all vending machines,
	where you can select a machine and it then updated statistics for that
	machine in the statistic tabs
[ ] MarketingGUI: 
[ ] Statistics: Get first draft of statistics charts working
[ ] Main: Lock ensuring only one instance of the program can be overridden
	by pressing enter in the command line. Program then opens another mainGUI
	and you can log in to the same vending machine at the same time from the
	different main GUIs.

-------------------------------
medium priority
-------------------------------
[x] when using an existing database the program should tell you how many
    machines there with their dimensions
[ ] CustomerGUI: add item amounts in the total stock list of the main window
[x] RestockerGUI: columns in all stock lists should not be movable or resizable
[x] RestockerGUI: You should be able to see the dimension of the machine,
	so that the restocker knows what row, col, depth are
[ ] RestockerGUI: all stock lists should be ordered by row-column
[x] MainGUI: Input for ID field is not checked for correctness. You can input
	negative numbers, 0, too large numbers, or letters. All these lead to
	errors being thrown.
[x] MainGUI: When entering machine ID, it should tell you what your choices
	are, that is how many machines there are.
[ ] MarketingGUI and RestockerGUI: when viewing the notes, there should be a
	field on the top containing the machine ID and a field containing the date.
	The note can be in the main text field as it is right now.
[ ] CustomerGUI: You can click on the columns in the total stock list and
	change the ordering of the items in the list.

-------------------------------
low priority
-------------------------------
[ ] RestockerGUI: item price field currently allows numbers with more than
	two decimal values after the dot.
[x] RestockerNote: date should be changed to Calendar class and all functions
	should be refactored to work correctly with Calendar.
[ ] MarketingNote: date should be changed to Calendar class and all functions
	should be refactored to work correctly with Calendar.
[ ] All windows should not be resizable.

fixed
-------------------------------
[x] CustomerGUI: clicking the remove button when nothing is selected results
    in an error. the button could be greyed out, when no item is selected
[x] CustomerGUI: when you select an item and click add, the item gets
    deselected, but the add button does not grey out. Clicking the add button
    without selecting a new item results in an error.
[x] CustomerGUI: the checkout button could be greyed out, if there is no item
    in the shopping cart. The error popup method works, but is annoying.
[x] CustomerGUI: the item list on the second screen should have the same
    appearance as on the first screen (add names for each column)
[x] CustomerGUI: second screen should say shopping cart on top of the list
[x] CustomerGUI: list on the second screen needs a scroll bar
[x] CustomerGUI: you can click on the column names on the first screen and drag
    the columns to a different position. This breaks the program, since it then
    gets wrong information from the table.
[x] CustomerGUI: Ordering in all lists should be according to row-col
[x] CustomerGUI: when calculating the total cost in the second screen, the
    amount gets displayed as $52.40, but because of precision the system has it
    as $52.4000000000006. so, if you insert $52.40 exactly, it will tell you
    that you have not enough money.
[x] RestockerGUI: closing the GUI causes the program to end.
[x] RestockerGUI: GUI should inform you if there is incorrect input when
	trying to add items. It should not clear the fields in that case and tell
	you what field is incorrect, so that the restocker can simply fix the
	incorrect field and add the item. The next few points tie into this:
[x] RestockerGUI: item amount field should only accept numbers from 1 to depth
[x] RestockerGUI: item amount field should not accept letters or be empty
[x] RestockerGUI: item row/col field should only accept numbers 1 to row/col
[x] RestockerGUI: item price field should only allow numbers and be not empty
[x] lock functionality has to be implemented for customer and restocker
[x] customerGUI does not clear shopping cart when closing with the red x
[x] CustomerGUI: add more info to the item info bar (or at least say 
    price: $x.xx instead of just $x.xx)
[x] CustomerGUI: items can be bought in the GUI but the system does not update
    and the report file does not get written
[x] CustomerGUI: when closing the GUI the stock file does not get updated
[x] RestockerGUI: has to implement the machine lock feature to prevent
	customers from using the same machine at the same time
[x] RestockerGUI: Needs restock option (button) for selected item. When
	restocking, only the expiration date has to be specified.
[x] RestockerGUI: Adding an item to a place where another item already is,
	should not be allowed
[x] RestockerGUI: If there is an item at a position, you can add another item
	with the same name but different price and exp date to the same position.
[x] RestockerGUI: item name field can currently be empty when adding an item
[x] RestockerGUI: date field should not be allowed to be empty.
[x] If you open CustomerGUI and buy an item, and then open RestockerGUI
	the program breaks.
[x] CustomerGUI and other GUIs should have the machine ID in the title

-------------------------------
not needed to fix
-------------------------------
[n?] you should be able to quit out of making a new database
[n] CustomerGUI: GUI has no close button
[n] CustomerGUI: when closing the GUI the system does not go back to the
    customer, resocker, marketing selection

uncertain

[?] lock for customer sometimes does not work
