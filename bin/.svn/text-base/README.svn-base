WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM ABOUT?

The Smart Vending Machine system encompasses the model, views,
and actions which need to be performed for a database of
vending machines. SVM enables the interfaces of the
marketing, customer, and restocker's perspectives in order to
complete transactions, restock the machine, allow for
management of the machine's stock, and create documented 
statistics for the lifetime of each machine in a user friendly
format.

**************************************************************

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM

To run the program, simply locate SVM.jar file on your
computer and double click it. A window will open, presenting
you with the startup interface of the Smart Vending Machine
system.

**************************************************************

STARTUP INTERFACE

The startup interface will allow you to either use an existing
database of vending machines or to create a new database.
On creating a new database, the program will prompt you for the
number of vending machines greater than 0 you would like to
create on the SVM server, as well as for the dimension of the
vending machines. Dimensions include the number of rows and
columns in the machines as well as the depth of each slot. Depending
on memory limitations and allocation on your personal computer,
you may be limited for the amount of vending machines and
their dimensions that you wish to create. Please also pay
attention to the fact that creating a new database will
erase any existing database in the process.

**************************************************************

MAIN INTERFACE

The main interface, which is displayed after the startup 
interface, contains options for which GUI perspective you
would like to remotely access any vending machine.
Your options are as follows:

---------------
CustomerUI
RestockerUI
MarketingUI
---------------

Note that the main interface will be your home base when using
the SVM system. Any perspective you connect to will open in a 
new window that you can close when you are done. The main 
interface will stay open during the use of this program and 
will allow you to access several perspectives at the same time. 
When you want to close the program you can close the main 
interface, which will then shut down any open perspective you 
may still have open.

**************************************************************

OPENING INTERFACES

The transition to interfaces occur when you select either
the customer, restocker, or marketing button from the main
interface screen. Opening interfaces is an important step
to accessing a vending machine from the perspective of your
choosing. Upon entering the restocker or customer interface,
you will be prompted with the following message:

---------------
Enter the ID of the vending machine
---------------

The ID is the numbering system for vending machines in the
database. IDs go from 1 to the number of vending machines
in the database.
This prompt is essentially asking you which machine you wish
to attach your perspective to. You can always exit a interface
at any point in time.

**************************************************************

CUSTOMER GUI

The customer GUI perspective is used to make purchases of items
on the vending machine it is currently "attached" to. Upon
entering the customer interface, you will see a lock screen.
Clicking on the screen will unlock the vending machine for
your use. If there is a different perspective already attached
to the vending machine you will be unable to unlock it and
will have to wait until the other perspectives disengage their
lock.

Upon unlocking you will enter the main customer GUI screen
that will contain a list of the items that are stocked in
the vending machine and your shopping cart that contains
items you selected to buy. You will be able to cancel any
action at any point in the customer interface.

FILLING THE SHOPPING CART

To add an item to your shopping cart, simply start by
selecting the item from the list. Once selected, the item
price will be displayed and you will be able to choose how
many of this item you want to buy by clicking the left and
right arrows. When you have made your selection, you can
then click the "Add item" button to add the selected amount
of that item to your shopping cart. You may then continue
to add more items to your shopping cart. Should you decide
to not buy an item after all, you can select it in the
shopping cart and click the "Remove Item" button. If you are
satisfied with your selections, you can click the "Checkout"
button to move to the checkout screen.

CHECKING OUT

The checkout screen will contain your shopping cart with the
items you selected. You will also see the total cost of your
selection, as well as the money you have already inserted
into the vending machine. Press the "Add money" button to
go a new screen where you can input the amount of money
you want to insert. Once you have added money to pay for
your items, you may press the "Buy" button. If you added
enough money, the machine will dispense your items and
return any change.
 

**************************************************************

RESTOCKER GUI

The restocker GUI is from the perspective of the restocker. A
restocker can do things such as download and upload vending
machine information and manage items. When entering the GUI,
you are prompted with the following choices:

---------------
Read Restocker Note
Read Marketing Note
Edit Stock
List Stock
---------------

The different modes can be used as follows:

---------------
Read Restocker Note
---------------

Using this option allows you to see the current restocker note
set by the last restocker on that particular machine. You will
be able to edit the note in this screen. To edit the note, just 
type in any notes you wish to save, then click the save button.
Clicking on back will revert any changes you have made if you 
have not clicked on the save button.

---------------
Read Marketing Note
---------------

Using this option allows you to see the current marketing note
set by the last marketing on that particular machine. These
will hold instructions on which items to add to or remove
from the machine.

---------------
Edit Stock
---------------

Upon choosing the edit stock option, you are given the 
following information:

- A list of the current stock in the machine
- Options to add or remove items
- The marketing notes (displayed at the top of the screen)

ADDING NEW ITEMS

To add a new item to the machine, input the necessary
information and then press "Add". Information that has
to be provided contains:

- Item Name: The name of the item
- Amount: The amount of the item you will be adding
- Row: The row to place the item in
- Column: The column to place the item in
- Price: The price of the item
- Expiration Date: The date the item will expire

If the item information is correct and does not conflict
with already existing stock, the item will be added to
the vending machine. If any errors were made, you will
be prompted with a helpful message dialogue informing
you of the mistake made.

RESTOCKING ITEMS

To restock an item, select the item in the stock list,
specify a new expiration date and click "Restock".
The location of that item will then be completely refilled
with the selected item, where the added items will have
a new expiration date.

REMOVING ITEMS

There are two options when removing items.

"Remove Selected Item" will remove the item that you
selected in the stock list from the vending machine.
If there are more than one items at that location,
all of them will be removed and the location cleared.

"Remove Expired Items" will automatically check every
item and remove all expired ones from the machine.

---------------
List Stock
---------------

This will present you with a list of the current stock in
the vending machine that will contain information about
the stocked items.

**************************************************************

MARKETING GUI

The marketing GUI is used for all marketing perspective actions
such as downloading and uploading notes, checking on current
stock in each machine, and viewing statistics for any number
of machines individually or as a whole.

---------------
Marketing Interface Main
---------------

The marketing interface is resizable, unlike the 
graphical user interfaces for the customer and restocker. This
is to allow for more desktop user friendly software.

The different parts of the interface are as follows:

- Vending Machine Selection

- Option Tabs [which include...]
    - List Stock
    - Restocker [Note]
    - Marketing [Note]
    - Item %
    - Item Gross
    - % Reasons Item Sold
    - Income Graph
    
- Main Viewing Window

Any of the tabs which are selected will display in the main
viewing window for viewing and/or managing the machines.


VENDING MACHINE SELECTION

The vending machine selection can be done on the left hand
side of your interface. To select a single vending machine, 
you only need to click one of the machines listed, then click
on the update button below. To access multiple machines is 
just as easy, you only need to select the machines you want
and then proceed to click update. 

You can deselect all or select all items with the user 
friendly buttons below, but you must still click update to 
refresh the machine views for statistics or machine 
management.

Please note that the IDs shown in the box below the list of
vending machines is not the updated view you are looking at.
It is only the machines you currently have selected in the
list itself. Yet again, a simple click on update will fix
this.

OPTION TABS

---------------
LIST STOCK
---------------

The list stock tab is very similar to the interface which a
restocker has access to on their respective GUI. All machines
selected will display their respective current stock, as well
as the total amount of stock contained in the machine, and
the total price that those stock are worth.

---------------
RESTOCKER
---------------

The restocker tab displays all notes for each vending machine
selected which are from the restocker. Each of these notes
contains a date and machine ID for readability.

---------------
MARKETING
---------------

The marketing tab is similar to that of the restocker tab.
Upon clicking on the tab, you are greeted with an initial 
screen which either allows you to enter a read only view, or
an edit view. In the edit view, you are able to edit notes 
by the masses if you wish to send out the same notes to 
multiple vending machines.

---------------
ITEM %
---------------

The item % tab shows you the percents of items sold in the 
form of a pie graph. This feature is useful with the 
selection of multiple vending machines, as you can see the
overall selling rate of specific items over a wide range of 
locations.

---------------
ITEM GROSS
---------------

The item gross tab shows you the gross profits of all items
sold in the selected vending machines.

---------------
% REASON ITEM SOLD
---------------

The % reason item sold tab allows you to pick an item from 
the selected vending machines. After picking an item from the
list, you are shown pie chart which displays the percentages
of reasons why this certain item was removed from the machine.
The three possibilities are as follows:

- SOLD: the item was sold to a customer

- EXPIRED: the item was removed by a restocker due to 
expiration

- BY_REQUEST: the item was removed by a restocker by request
from the marketing department

---------------
INCOME GRAPH
---------------

The income graph shows the total income over the total life 
span of vending machines selected. You can see the gross
profits on the Y-Axis vs. time on the X-Axis.

**************************************************************

---------------
    Memory
---------------

Because this program could potentially be run and scripted to
be run with a large amount of vending machines, there is no
maximum amount of vending machines the code is limited to 
creating on startup. If your computer does not designate or
cannot handle a large amount of machines when you try to 
allocate them, this program will initially break. Please use
your own judgment when creating a system of SVM's.
